Abstract:

A. Patches to SuperNu, Version 3.x, added at LANL:
==================================================

(1) 3D Cylindrical IMC-DDMC and minor patches (default branch):

At LANL, modifications to enable 3D cylindrical IMC-DDMC were made to the
following files:
-- inputparmod.f
-- inputstrmod.f
-- particle_advance.f90
-- particle_advance_gamgrey.f90
-- SOURCE/boundary_source.f90
-- SOURCE/initial_particles.f90
-- GRID/leakage_opacity2.f90
-- TRANSPORT2/transport2.f90
-- TRANSPORT2/diffusion2.f90
-- TRANSPORT2/transport2_gamgrey.f90

The generalization of 2D cylindrical to 3D cylindrical geometry does not
extend the physics capbilities of SuperNu, which had 3D Cartesian and 3D
spherical IMC-DDMC implemented prior to SuperNu Version 3.x.

(2) Lambda-T optimization ("wlT" branch):

The following summary pertains to a discontinued branch for an attempted
optimization at LANL.  The implementation of the dual grid wlT optimization,
which was part of the LANL copyright assertion, proved inaccurate in supernova
light curve calculations.

An alternate form of an optimization in the IMC-DDMC radiation transport code
SuperNu was developed and tested at LANL.  This optimization involves storing
a non-dimensional wavelength grid for computing opacities and tracking Monte
Carlo photon radiation particles.  The physical wavelength grid is the
non-dimensional grid divided by the local spatial cell gas temperature.

The patch to the optimization is:
-- the removal of temperature corrections to DDMC particle weights,
-- the introduction of a dual wavelength grid that is dimensional and uniform
in space.

The temperature correction to DDMC particle weights seemed to result naturally from
the transport equations but could not be theoretically justified and was deemed
a bug.  The additional wavelength grid is applied in DDMC propagation of particles
and calculation of DDMC leakage opacities to avoid in-line Planck integrals at
IMC-DDMC interfaces (an expense that would otherwise be incurred by using the
non-dimensional grid without temperature corrections in DDMC).  The new wavelength
grid also adapts in time to cover all dimensional frequencies implied by the
non-dimensional grid and the material temperature field.

Despite the advantage of a global group Planck function integral array, the
dual-grid patch to the non-dimensional multigroup scheme requires a mapping
of multigroup opacity to the dimensional dual grid.

To implement the wavelength dual-grid optimization, modifications included:
-- addition of new input parameters and allocatable arrays to handle
mapping from nondimensional to dimensional wavelength grid,
-- addition of a subroutine to adapt the dimensional wavelength grid each
time step (called "group_update"),
-- addition of a function (called "regroup") that maps multigroup data
from the non-dimensional to the dimensional wavelength grid,
-- modification of IMC-DDMC particle exchange conditions to use values
mapped from the regroup function.
